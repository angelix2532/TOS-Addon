# CharSimulator
This is an in-game character **appearance** simulator that allow you to preview costume and stuff on your current character (dye and lense included) with larger image. Just use command /sim to open the simulator and press ESC to close the simulator. Please note that hair costume is buggy as this addon uses the same code as TP-shop. Anyway, enjoy!
